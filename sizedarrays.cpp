    VARIABLE SIZED ARRAYS CHALLENGE:
    
    Task:
        Consider an n-element array, a, where each index i in the array contains a reference to an array of k[i] integers (where the value of k[i] varies from array to array).
        
        Given a, you must answer q queries. Each query is in the format i j, where i denotes an index in array a and j denotes an index in the array located at a[i]. For each query, find and print the value of element j in the array at location a[i] on a new line.

    Input Format:

        The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries).
        
        Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the k-element array located at a[i].
        
        Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of i (an index in array a) and j (an index in the array referenced by a[i]) for a query.

    Constraints:
        1 <= n <= 10^5
        1 <= q <= 10^5
        1 <= k <= 3*10^5
        n <= sumatory of k <= 3*10^5
        0 <= i < n
        0 <= j < k

    Output Format:

        For each pair of i and j values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located at index j of the array referenced by a[i]. There should be a total of q lines of output.
